                    <h4>Hello! I'm Myles Lister and I'm the one who developed this application. </h4>
                    <h4>Iâ€™m a graduate of a full stack development program at devCodeCamp.</h4>
                    <h4>This application was built using technologies in the front-end like React.js and Axios for making the API calls. Edamam Food API to find the data on user input, Bootstrap and CSS for styling.</h4>
                    <h4>For the back-end, I used Django REST Framework to build the models and the web API. MySQL to store user, recipe information and JWT for authentication.</h4>
                    <h4>Supporting technologies were Postman for testing the end points, ensuring GET and POST were being made. Of course, Git and GitHub to store and share the code.</h4>
